# Project name : Image Classification<br/>

### Duration : Feb 2018 – Mar 2018<br/>

### Project description : <br/>
   ### ● In this project, the goal was to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, ships, Automobile, dogs, cats, and other objects.<br/><br/>

   ### ● The dataset needed to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. Further, the task was to normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels &next to build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer.<br/><br/>

   ### ● At the end, their predictions on the sample images were derived.
